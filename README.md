# Command Executer AI Agent for windows 
![Logo](workfllow.jpeg)


Codex is a CLI that serves as an AI agent to execute Windows commands for enhancing security and privacy of the operating system data. It interacts with the Ollama Llama 3.1 model and langchain to provide efficient command execution without the need for internet connectivity, saving valuable time and security.

## Features
- U don't need to learn windows command prompt  
- Securely execute Windows commands by using the power of llm models 
- Enhance privacy settings of the operating system
- No internet connectivity required


## Installation
1. u need first to download ollama from offical website https://ollama.com/ then pull the llama3.1 llm model using ollama pull llama3.1 command
2. Download the latest release of the Command Executer AI Agent from the [releases](https://github.com/abdallahlakh/codex-agent) page .
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location on your computer then you need to download requirements libaries from requirements.txt file.
4. Run python cli.py run and start using it.

## Usage

Describe to him what you want to do in your operationg system then he will transform it to the corresponding windows command using llama3.1 llm model.



## Why you should use this agent?

### 1. User Convenience and Efficiency
- **Simplified Command Execution**: Users can describe what they want to do in natural language, and the AI agent translates that into the appropriate command.
- **Time-Saving**: Reduces the time spent looking up command syntax and parameters.

### 2. Accessibility
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Makes command-line tools accessible to users who may not be familiar with command-line interfaces.
- **Inclusive**: Helps users with disabilities by allowing voice commands or simpler text inputs.

### 3. Error Reduction
- **Minimize Human Error**: Reduces the likelihood of syntax errors or incorrect command usage.
- **Consistent Execution**: Ensures that commands are executed consistently and correctly.

### 4. Learning and Adaptation
- **Learning Tool**: Acts as a learning tool for users who are new to command-line interfaces.
- **Adaptive**: Can be trained to understand and execute a wide range of commands.

### 5. Integration and Automation
- **Seamless Integration**: Can be integrated with other tools and systems to automate workflows.
- **Task Automation**: Automates routine tasks, freeing up time for more complex work.

### 6. Enhanced Productivity
- **Boost Productivity**: Streamlines command execution, allowing users to accomplish more in less time.
- **Focus on High-Level Tasks**: Allows users to focus on higher-level tasks and decision-making.

### 7. Scalability
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be scaled to support multiple users and integrated into larger systems.

## Example Use Cases
1. **System Administration**: Automate routine maintenance tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring.
2. **Development**: Simplify the process of running build scripts, deploying applications, and managing dependencies.
3. **Data Analysis**: Streamline data processing tasks by converting natural language queries into data manipulation commands.
4. **Customer Support**: Enable support staff to execute diagnostic commands and scripts without deep technical knowledge.

## Conclusion
This project leverages the power of language models to bridge the gap between natural language and command-line interfaces, making powerful tools more accessible and easier to use. It enhances productivity, reduces errors, and opens up new possibilities for automation and integration, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of users and applications.
